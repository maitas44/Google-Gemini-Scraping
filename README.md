# Google-Gemini-Scraping
Use Google Gemini API to scrap web dynamic web pages.

I tried scraping a dynamic webpage using Python's Selenium library. I wasn't able to understand how to use it ot screap dynamic content that does not show when inspecting the html code.

I decided to create a Linux VM, install a X11 UI, and a web browser with a pugling that reloads the page each 5 minutes.
Then I created:

1- A python script that captures the complete image and saves it to a jg file each 5 minutes using cron.

2- A python script that sends the jpg to the Google Gemini API and checks if the needed text is shown. If that text is shown, it writes a text file with the text "It is happening". It runs each 5 minutes using cron.

3- A python script that checks if the previous file shows the text "It is happening", if it des sends me a Telegram message. It runs each 5 minutes using cron.

How to set up the environment:

1- Create a Centos9 VM and install VNC server.

    sudo yum update

    sudo yum install tigervnc -y

    sudo yum install tigervnc-server -y

    sudo yum groupinstall "Server with GUI"  -y

    sudo systemctl stop firewalld

    sudo vncserver :1

// this step is to get a fresh xstartup file to edit. You need to set up a password.

    sudo vncserver -kill :1

    sudo vim /root/.vnc/xstartup

//edit /root/.vnc/xstartup and add "X11&" at the end as a new final line.

    sudo vncserver :1

Access your VNC instance using a VNC client. In my chromebook Linux enviornment I installed remina and start it with:

    /usr/bin/remmina

Once inside Centos9, open firefox. Install refresh plugin.

Check python version:

    python --version
    Python 3.9.18

Python 3.9 or greater is enough.

Create a python virtual environment

    python -m venv my_env

To enable the virtual environment:

    source my_env/bin/activate

To disable later on:

    (my_env) $ deactivate

Go to the directory

    cd my_env

Export display to the ssh session.

    export DISPLAY=:1

Install required library:

    pip install pyautogui

    sudo yum install -y python3-tkinter tk-devel 

Use an editor to create a capture.py file with the following data:

    import pyautogui
    import time
    while True:  # Loop runs forever
        try:
            # Take the screenshot
            my_screenshot = pyautogui.screenshot()
            # Generate a unique filename with a timestamp
            import datetime
            filename = "screenshot.jpg"
            # Save as a JPEGÂ 
            my_screenshot.save(filename, quality=95)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")  # Log any errors
        time.sleep(300)  # Wait 300 seconds (5 minutes)

keep it running on a terminal window:

    python capture.py

Open a new terminal and start the python virtual environment:
